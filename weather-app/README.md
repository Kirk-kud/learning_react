Weather App

This project was part of a group of mini-projects meant to deepen my understanding of React.js concepts.

This was the first React.js project that saw me use two external API endpoints to implement the main functionality.

Appreciation:
- API endpoint for all the cities in the world: [Postman Country API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52)
- API endpoint for current weather per city: [Weather API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/WeatherAPI.com/WeatherAPI/1.0.2#/APIs/realtime-weather)

The app allows the user to pick a city from a list of all the cities in the world and returns the following Weather statistics:
- General weather conditions (e.g: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy et cetera)
- Temperature in °C (Degree Celcius)
- Temperature in °F (Degree Fahrenheit)
- UV Index
- Humidity
